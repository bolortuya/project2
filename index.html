    <p id=intro_par> Welcome to all, and thank you for stopping by to look over my wares.  I have been doing fancy-work on-and-off for over fifty-five years, ever since I was initially taught it by an
    old sailor who lived quite close to me.  I used the know-edge through my Navy days and have now taken it up again as a full-time business.
    I make belts, lanyards, wheel-coverings, tiller-wraps, hand-rail wraps, bellropes of varying complexity, instrument straps, camera straps,  luggage slings....
    if you can do it with a piece of  line, I've probably either made it or seen it.  I can do MacNamara's lace and mast skirts, but  they tend to get verrrry
    expensive due to the great amount of time involved.
